Assumptions:

User does not need to configure bomb names or amount of bombs<br/>
User does not need reset the bomb timers. They can refresh the page to get new timers.<br/>
Since it is a simple app, displaying it in a small area is optimal.<br/>
App does not need to be 100% pixel perfect with the example in the pdf, since this was not stated.<br/>

I am running the app and tests on vite<br/>
The starting app I was given didn't seem to have anything to do with the online assessment prompt I was given.<br/>
So apologies if the setup isn't what you were expecting.<br/>
Have a good day! :)
